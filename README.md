# Pet Shop
 A Database Project made with mysql


•	Problem consists of having a system to manage a pet shop by registering staff, products and pets available in the shop and keeping count of the payments done by clients which are also registered in the database. 


•	My database consists of an imaginary pet shop where it contains different animals from different classes like reptiles, mammals, amphibians, birds and fishes. Each class is located in different sectors and there’s one employee for each sector. One manager manages all the employees. The store also contains products for animals like shampoo, toys, habitat . In the database there are also clients registered where a specific column is reserved for their information A table is reserved for bill where you can add what a specific client has bought and the quantity and by custom function you can calculate the total amount of payment the client has made.



There are 3 users :
Admin --- user = admin    password=admin
employee --- user = employee    password=employee
client --- user = client    password=client


All tables and their data are available in tables.pdf
